This is a python program that will automatically set up a lab template for every lab assignment for a computer science class taught by Professor Rice at Olivet Nazarene University. First download the code and run it by entering python pythonCanvasAPIInteractor.py into the command prompt. Note that the current directory must contain the pythonCanvasAPIInteractor.py file so you will probably need to change your directory to Downloads. Once there follow the images listed below in order to get the Canvas Bearer Token. After that, follow the instructions given by the program and you should have all of your labs setup with a template and correct names and due dates.
